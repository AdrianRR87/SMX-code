A repository that contains a library used for the calibration of the SMX v2.2 ASIC.
It contains a class with multiple functions, most of which are oriented towards calibrating the ADC and FAST discriminator, as well as checking the response of the Analog front-end circuits to injected pulses of variable amplitude.
